# Kubernetes High-Level Load Balancer
## Overview
The Kubernetes High-Level Load Balancer project is an advanced load balancing solution designed for Kubernetes clusters. It offers easy configurability with both static and dynamic load balancing algorithms. Additionally, the load balancer introduces custom algorithms that calculate metrics such as CPU, RAM, network bandwidth, etc. These metrics are dynamically used to determine the best replica of a pod to route traffic to, evolving over time based on configurable equations.

## Features
- Configurability: Easily configure static and dynamic load balancing algorithms.
- Custom Metrics: Utilize custom algorithms to calculate metrics like CPU, RAM, and network bandwidth.
- Dynamic Routing: Determine the best replica of a pod dynamically based on configurable equations.
- Scalability: Adapt to changing loads and cluster sizes seamlessly.
- Kubernetes Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly with Kubernetes clusters.
